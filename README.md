# About the project
## What is this?
This is my Java Code project which I will turn it in as homework.

The requirements for the homework are:
- Theres a GUI
- Theres a Database and interaction between them
- A hard-copy of the program on a Physical CD.
- A paper report to instruct how to install and use your program.
- That's all?

## What is it specifically?
I decided to make a game, where there's like a laserbeam projector, then there's a lot of mirror pieces on the board to redirect the laser

The goal is to redirect it to a special unit called laserbeam receiver. 

I could write a level generator and a level checker, then use those same things in Level Editor, which will Save/Load a level to a SQL Database.

Visionary. I know.

## Why do i decide to make a game when there is only 4 days remaining?
Because i believe in the magic of stella.

# Figuring out how should one approach 
## Planning
The most important lesson that magic of stella taught me is to have a plan. It isn't necessarily be a perfect one, just one reasonably divides work down to small milestones, where each milestone is needed for some other milestones. 

A plan is critical since with it we can keep track of how the project is turning out and keep track of the remaining time.

The time needed for each milestone is not more than 2 days (this is not from magic of stella, this is an idea from some of the seniors that oversee our `Centre-of-Attention` project), so that it is easier to manage each one.

### My Plan

I sketched a lot of ideas, so I know beforehand which feature is core, which feature is negligible. It's fine if some of them don't make it to the final version.

With this sketch, I have a general idea how to approach the project with such little time and with no firsthand experience before.

### My IDE
Usually, I'd prefer to not use any good IDE that conveniently construct and organize a code project for me like `Eclipse`, jetbrains's like `IntelliJ`. I like fooling around with how to organize my own codes but this time I want to try out how convenient it is.

`Eclipse` is unexpectedly great. I coded with its default light theme :). It supports `git` and such, making my life way easier. Generally I could understand its menu layout so i could use it much without looking up too often.

I would recommended `Eclipse` if your project is large and organizing source files is tiring to you (my OCD allows me to organize my files with passion :))

## Coding
I learnt `Java` and its core libraries for about 3 months already before this project, so I can easily see what is possible and what is not. I used plenty from `Java Collections Framework`, `Java AWT` and `Java Swings`.

I don't think there is anything to say in this part. For me, this phase is kind of a blank in my head. I couldn't remember it clearly. I just coded like crazy.

# Results
It turns out great. I had to cut some features so I could make it to the deadline. I ended up submitting version 0.8 to the teacher, which has everything but the drawing laser feature. You could read about the version in the `\release` section. Although i did make a mistake here, levels that are created by the user is actually playable..

## 2020 Jul 20th Update:
Today I worked a little bit on the drawing laser feature. It's not the flashiest thing, but It looks kinda nice :v I want to finish this soon and close it already haha.

Not what i was going for, but this will work.
