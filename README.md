### This is a Java code-project that I will turn in as homework points
The requirements are:
- Theres a GUI
- Theres a Database and interaction between them
- A hard-copy of the program on a Physical CD.
- A paper report to instruct how to install and use your program.
- That's all?

### What do I do?
I decided to make a game, where there's like a laserbeam projector, then there's a lot of mirror pieces on the board to redirect the laser

The goal is to redirect it to a special unit called laserbeam receiver.

Simple.

I could write a level generator and a level checker, then use those same things in Level Editor, which will Save/Load a level to a SQL Database.

Visionary. I know.

### Why do i decide to make a game when there is only 4 days remaining
Because i believe in the magic of stella.
